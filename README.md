Repository for assignment 3 in _Principles of Object Oriented Programming_. Design and implementation of a mini rouge-like game in terminal (no items).

The crux of this assignment is the integration of different kinds of enemies,
kinds of player classes and kinds of map tiles (like a trap or a wall for example)
while keeping the software as modular as possible using object oriented tools and design patters like visitor and observer.
